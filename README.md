### Hi, I'm Lukas!

I'm a data analyst and progammer who has worked in the healthcare industry in the US for the past 7 years. I mainly work in `Python`, `R`, `SQL`, and `SAS`, and I am always trying to learn new coding languages and data analysis techniques. I am interested in the applications of mathematical modeling and statistics to biological and medical research.

I use this profile to store projects I work on in my free time. The README for each package contains project overviews as well as examples and illustrations. 

Check out some of my repositories:
- [Bioinformatics-Tools](https://github.com/lukas-owens/Bioinformatics-Tools) implements some common algorithms used in bioinformatics and computational biology, including sequence alignment and phylogenetic tree construction. It includes an example analysis that builds an evolutionary tree for a variety of vertebrates based on comparisons of their hemoglobin protein sequences.
- [Heart-Disease](https://github.com/lukas-owens/Heart-Disease) is a data exploration and predictive modeling analysis of risk factors for coronary heart disease based on a survey of adult males in three rural communities in South Africa. I explored the interaction between various risk factors such as age, family history, tobacco use and other possible indicators. I started this project while studying for the Predictive Analytics actuarial exam.
- [Baseball-Ratings](https://github.com/lukas-owens/Baseball-Ratings) calculates Elo ratings for MLB teams for the past decade using the Retrosheet database. It also contains visualizations of team performance for recent years.
- [Hospital-Index](https://github.com/lukas-owens/Hospital-Index) is a visualization of Medicare FFS inpatient claims at hospitals in the US based on publicly-available data from CMS. I plotted hospital volume by county and calculated a case-mix index based on standard DRG weights by region.

I'm always looking for new projects and collaborators, so please reach out if you're interested in working together.
