### Hi, I'm Lukas!

I'm a data analyst who has worked in the healthcare industry in the US for the past 6+ years. My interests lie in the intersection between math, economics, medicine, and problem-solving. I am fluent in `Python`, `R`, `SQL`, `SAS`, and enjoy learning new programming languages and data analysis techniques.

I use this profile to store projects I work on in my free time. Feel free to poke around and message me if you have any questions or requests. I'm always looking for new projects and collaborators, so please reach out if you're interested in working together.

Check out some of my repositories:
- `Hospital-Index` is a visualization of Medicare FFS inpatient claims at hospitals in the US based on publicly-available fiscal year 2015 data from CMS. I used this data to plot hospital volume and a calculated case-mix index based on standard DRG payment rates by region.
- `Baseball-Ratings` is a hobby project of mine that calculates Elo-like ratings for MLB teams for the past decade using the Retrosheet database. It has some fun visualizations of team performance form year-to-year (or maybe not so fun if you're also a fan of the Seattle Mariners).
- `Parallel-Processor` is a Python script I wrote several years ago for queueing many tasks across different machines connected on a local network. I mainly wrote it to practice using Python's networking features but it can be quite useful for setting up distributed computing tasks .
